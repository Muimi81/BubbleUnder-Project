        <h2>
            About Us
        </h2>
        <p>
            <span class="fun">Bubble Under</span> is a group of diving enthusiasts based in the south-west UK 
            who meet up for diving trips in the summer months when the weather is good and the bacon rolls are flowing.
            We arrange weekends away as small groups to cut the costs of accomodation and travel and
            to ensure that everyone gets a trustworthy dive buddy.
        </p>
        <p>
            Although we're based in the south-west, we don't stay on our own turf: past diving 
            weekends away have included trips up to Scapa Flow in Scotland and to Malta's numerous
            wreck sites.
        </p>
        <p>
            When we're not diving, we often meet up in a local pub to talk about our recent 
            adventures (<em>any</em> excuse, eh?).
        </p>
        <p>
            Or as our man Bob Dobalina would put it:
        </p>

        <blockquote class="fun">
            <p>
                "Happiness is a dip in the ocean followed by a pint or two of Old Speckled Hen.
                You can quote me on that!"
            </p>
            <p>
                "Join us for a weekend away at some of our favorite dive spots and you'll soon be making new friends."
            </p>
            <p>
                "Anyway, about time I got on with some <em>proper</em> work!"
            </p>
        </blockquote>
