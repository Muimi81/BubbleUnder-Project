            Image Gallery
        </h2>

        <p>
            Below are some of the great views that club members have captured on film (or digital memory), on various
            dive trips.
        </p>

        <p>
            Please do drop me a line (that's Bob) if you would like to
            <a href="mailto:nzangi@quantbuild.co.ke">Submit an Image</a> to this gallery.

            <img src="gallery/turtle-bite.PNG" width="400" height="258" alt="A turtle swims comfortably among coral,
            despite its old injury - a large shark bit on one side" />
            <p>
                This turtle was spotted swiming around the Great Barrier Reef (Queensland, Australia) quite gracefully,
                despite having had a large chunk taken out of its right side, presumably in a shark attack.

            <img src="gallery/jelly-fish.PNG" width="400" height="300"
            alt="A jellyfish flanked by smaller fish" />
            <p>
                Jill was just snorkelling when she took this picture - the jellyfish was only a couple of feet under the
                surface, hence the light is excellent. Jill assures us that the jellyfish had no "tasty, stingy, dangly bits"!

                "I was right next to him as he bit chunks of coral off for dinner - what a sound!" So describes club 
                member Paul who took this shot on Fiji.
